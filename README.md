# Laravel 12 Filament Public Admin Panel

Hi Future Developer,

Welcome to the **Laravel 12 Filament Public Admin Panel**! This project is an open-source admin panel built with the latest Laravel 12 and Filament PHP 3, designed for personal utility management and more.

This repository is the public evolution of my previous private admin panel project (originally developed with Laravel 10). Here, I‚Äôve upgraded to Laravel 12 and made the core features available for the community‚Äîideal for learning, collaboration, or as a starting point for your own admin panel. To support public usage, user roles and permissions have been carefully separated and managed.

While this repository is public, please note that important configuration files such as `.env` and the application database are not provided. Although you can access and use the live version, access to the production database and sensitive configuration remains restricted for security reasons. However, I‚Äôm always open to discuss and help if you need guidance regarding configuration or setup.
